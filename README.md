This will be a place to put various small tools for phylogenetic analysis.

At the moment, only one tool is here: StripTrease. This removes annotations from tree string for program which cannot handle annotations.

To compile, simply type:

	make

in a commandline prompt. All tools will (probably) use the same makefile. To get instructions for a given tool, type:

	./toolname -h
